# Actions (opt-in)

Read-only by default. Actions are a separate tool set you enable on purpose.
Transaction warnings are dismissed and reported in `warningsDismissed` (omitted when empty); errors that cannot be safely resolved roll back the action.

Action tools have no `document` or timeout arguments.
They use the default timeouts and require exactly one instance returned by the transport.
HTTP addresses one endpoint; the file transports discover workstation instances.
All IDs are unitless Revit element IDs.
Revit 2022–2023 accept IDs up to 2,147,483,647 only; larger IDs fail on those years.

Action jobs with `targetDocument` resolve that reference when the add-in executes the job.
The reference must match exactly one open document by a case-insensitive substring of its title or file name.
The resolved document is bound by its title and full path for all mutations and verification, even if another document is active.
An unknown or closed target returns `The addressed document '<TargetDocument>' is not open.`
An ambiguous target returns `The document reference '<TargetDocument>' is ambiguous (N open documents match); use a more specific substring.`
Resolution failure aborts the whole batch before any step runs; an addressed job never falls back to the active document.
The target is resolved once before the batch loop, and a later document or transaction failure is reported as a step error.
`select`, `show` and `isolate` (including `reset=true`) require the resolved document to be active.
Otherwise, they return `Cannot run '<command>' on '<title>' because it is not the active document; activate it in Revit first.`
Jobs without `targetDocument` retain the active-document behavior.
`activeView` always reports the actual active view, even when a mutation targets another document.

| Tool | Arguments | Action and units |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `revit_select` | `element_ids` | Select IDs; `[]` clears selection. Return `count`, the current selection size after the call. |
| `revit_show` | `element_ids`, `select=true` | Show nonempty IDs; return `activeView`, `viewOpened` and `count`, the current selection size after the call. With `select=false`, `count` reports the previous selection. |
| `revit_isolate` | `element_ids`, `reset=false` | Temporarily isolate IDs; `element_ids=[]` with `reset=true` clears hide/isolate. |
| `revit_move` | `element_ids`, `dx_mm`, `dy_mm`, `dz_mm=0` | Move by model-axis offsets in mm. |
| `revit_place_family` | `family`, `type_name`, `x_mm`, `y_mm`, `level`, `rotation_deg=0` | Place a loaded family at model XY in mm on a named level; rotate about Z in degrees. |
| `revit_create_wall` | `start_mm`, `end_mm`, `level`, `wall_type`, `height_mm=3000` | Create a straight wall; endpoints are `[x,y]` in model mm. |
| `revit_create_floor` | `points_mm`, `level`, `floor_type` | Create a floor from a closed boundary; `points_mm` are `[x,y]` polygon vertices in model mm, at least 3, closed automatically; null `floor_type` chooses the first floor type. |
| `revit_set_phase` | `element_ids`, `created_phase`, `demolished_phase` | Assign project phases by exact name; each phase argument is a name, `""` to clear that assignment, or null to leave it unchanged; at least one non-null. The Revit API cannot create or rename phases — add new phases in the UI first. |
| `revit_merge_phases` | `source_phase`, `target_phase` | Move every creation and demolition reference off the source phase into the target, then delete the empty source phase; a refused deletion is reported with `sourceDeleted:false` and `phaseDeleteError`. Not batchable. |
| `revit_set_parameter` | `element_id`, `parameter`, `value` | Set a string value by parameter name; lengths use mm, areas m2, other doubles internal units. |
| `revit_delete` | `element_ids` | Delete nonempty IDs and their dependents. |
| `revit_batch` | `steps`, `dry_run=false` | Execute 1–50 actions with a single undo entry named `revit_batch`. |

`type_name`, `wall_type` and `floor_type` are required arguments that accept `null`.

`revit_move`, `revit_place_family`, `revit_create_wall`, `revit_create_floor`, `revit_set_phase`, `revit_merge_phases`, `revit_set_parameter` and `revit_delete` accept a final `dry_run=false` argument.
A dry run executes the mutation, reads its prospective result, and rolls back the transaction.
A successful dry run includes `data.dryRun:true`, `data.rolledBack:true` and the same `verification` shape as a real write.
An action that throws returns an error without a verification block; a missing family also returns `closestFamilies` on the single-action tool.
`revit_isolate` has no `dry_run` argument; it uses temporary isolation only.
Created IDs in a dry run are provisional and do not identify persisted elements.

Successful real writes return `data.dryRun:false` and re-read the affected elements after commit.
`verification.before` is captured before the change; `verification.after` is re-read after commit or before rollback on a dry run.
`verification.error` reports a failed post-commit re-read; the change is committed.
Single-action responses include `failedStep:null`.
The `verification` block contains model facts: bounding boxes for moves, parameter values and ownership for parameter edits, element metadata for creation, and deleted/dependent IDs with a survival check for deletion.
Bounding boxes use model XYZ in mm rounded to one decimal; unavailable bounding boxes are omitted.
For example, setting Comments on element 123 returns:

```json
{
  "dryRun": false,
  "verification": {
    "before": {"id": 123, "parameter": "Comments", "value": "", "storageType": "String", "owner": "instance"},
    "after": {"id": 123, "parameter": "Comments", "value": "Reviewed", "storageType": "String", "owner": "instance"},
    "changed": [123]
  }
}
```

`revit_batch` takes action names and their normal snake_case arguments:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {"action": "move", "args": {"element_ids": [123], "dx_mm": 100, "dy_mm": 0}},
    {"action": "set_parameter", "args": {"element_id": 123, "parameter": "Comments", "value": "Reviewed"}}
  ],
  "dry_run": false
}
```

A successful batch assimilates its transactions into one undo entry named `revit_batch`.
The first failed step rolls back the entire batch; every attempted step, including the failing one, carries `rolledBack:true`.
An `Assimilate` failure is reported on the last step with `failedStep` pointing at it.
All steps are validated before execution; an invalid later step rejects the whole batch without executing anything and without `failedStep`.
Results include zero-based `index`, `command`, `success` and `data` or `error` per attempted step, plus `undoName`, `committed` and `failedStep` (null on success).
A batch dry run executes every step against preceding steps' changes, then rolls back the group and restores the original selection.
A per-step `dry_run:true` inside a real batch is accepted and previews only that step.
Verification describes each step's immediate result; subsequent steps may change those elements again.
Batches accept 1–50 steps; `select` and `isolate` are allowed, while `show`, nested batches and unknown argument keys are rejected.

`revit_show` checks the open UI views before calling `ShowElements`.
If none contains a requested element, it opens a non-template plan for an element's level.
Floor plans take priority, followed by names starting with the level name.
Without a matching plan it uses the first non-template 3D view.
The handler sets `UIDocument.ActiveView` synchronously inside its ExternalEvent without a transaction; `ShowElements` needs the view active immediately.
`RequestViewChange` defers the change until control returns to Revit.
The response includes `activeView` and `viewOpened`, which reports whether the handler opened a previously closed view.

During action execution, the handler attempts to dismiss TaskDialog prompts with OK and then Yes.
Messages from successful overrides appear in `dialogsSuppressed`.
The dialog handler is removed in `finally`, including on errors.
For the single-action `revit_place_family` tool, missing families return up to five similar names with their family categories in `closestFamilies`; unrelated names are omitted.
Inside `revit_batch`, a missing family surfaces only as `steps[].error` text; `closestFamilies` is unavailable.
For `Family: Type`, `type_name=null` uses the embedded type; a conflicting `type_name` is rejected.
For a family name alone, `type_name=null` selects the first loaded type.

Both gates must be enabled:

1. Set `REVIT_MCP_ALLOW_WRITE=1` in the Python server process environment and restart the server.
   With any other value or no value, MCP `list_tools` does not include the action tools.
2. Create `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RevitModelMcp\allow-write` on the Revit workstation:

   ```powershell
   New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\RevitModelMcp" | Out-Null
   New-Item -ItemType File -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\RevitModelMcp\allow-write" | Out-Null
   ```

The add-in checks the gate file for every action, including selection and navigation.
Without it, the response contains `success:false` and `error:"actions disabled on the workstation"`.
Removing the file disables actions immediately; restarting Revit is unnecessary.
The gate stays in the default local application data directory even if the transport uses `REVIT_MCP_CHANNEL_DIR`.

Actions address the process ID reported by the transport.
Coordinates use model axes and the named level's project elevation.
Pass `null` for `type_name` to choose the family's first type, or for `wall_type` to choose the first basic wall type.
Family placement uses the level-based, nonstructural overload; hosted, face-based and adaptive families may require another placement API and return an error.
The single-action family placement tool returns up to five closest loaded names for an unloaded family.
Parameter values use invariant numeric notation; other Double parameters use Revit internal units.
Type parameter edits affect all instances of that type and return `parameterScope:"type"`.
ElementId and read-only parameters cannot be set.

Responses from the action executor include `activeView`, including action errors.
Transport rejection and target-mismatch responses may omit action metadata.
Model changes and temporary isolation use individual transactions named after the tool.
`revit_batch` wraps the per-step transactions in a `TransactionGroup` named `revit_batch` and assimilates them into one undo entry.
Warnings at commit are dismissed and reported on successful actions.
Errors permit one `FixElements` or `SetValue` resolution when Revit allows it; unresolved or repeated errors roll back the transaction.
Selection and navigation use UI calls without model transactions.
The tools do not save the model.
After a timeout, inspect the model before retrying an action; the previous call may have executed.
