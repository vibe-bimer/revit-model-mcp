## Behavior and returned data {#contract}

!!! note "Usage notes"
    The complete current tool declaration is preserved below. The file channel has an implementation exception: it may return terminal `success:false`, `partial:true` data instead of the promised error. Accept complete results only with `success:true` and `partial:false` (or no partial field); a wait timeout does not cancel the job. See the [read response contract](../tools.md).

## Revit year support {#year-support}

| Revit year | Validation |
| --- | --- |
| 2020 | <span class="state part">Build only, not live-tested</span> |
| 2026 | <span class="state part">Build only, not live-tested</span> |
| 2022–2025 / 2027 | <span class="state part">Build only, not live-tested</span> |

Validated live means an execution was recorded on a real workstation. Build only means compilation passed, not live functional validation. Revit 2021 is outside this project's build targets.
