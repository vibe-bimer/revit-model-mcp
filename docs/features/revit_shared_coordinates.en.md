## Parameters {#parameters}

No additional business parameters; use the common parameters below.

### Common parameters {#common-parameters}

| Parameter | Required | Default | Type | Meaning |
| --- | :--: | --- | --- | --- |
| `document` | No | `null` | `string / null` | Case-insensitive document-title or file-name substring. Reads use it to address an instance; it must be unique with multiple instances. Actions use it to choose an open document in the addressed instance; required with multiple open documents. Unknown or ambiguous targets are rejected |
| `pickup_timeout_seconds` | No | `300` | `integer` | Positive seconds to wait for pickup over local or SSH (default 300); ignored over HTTP. A pending job may still execute after pickup times out |
| `timeout_seconds` | No | `120` | `integer` | Positive result-wait budget in seconds after pickup (default 120); HTTP uses it as the response budget. Does not override add-in execution limits; a timeout does not cancel a pending job |

## Behavior and returned data {#contract}

!!! note "Usage notes"
    The complete current tool declaration is preserved below. The file channel has an implementation exception: it may return terminal `success:false`, `partial:true` data instead of the promised error. Accept complete results only with `success:true` and `partial:false` (or no partial field); a wait timeout does not cancel the job. See the [read response contract](../tools.md).

Read project and survey coordinates before an export or hand-over.

Returns data with base/survey points, the active site, project locations and link offsets in mm and rotations in degrees, rounded to one decimal.
Location and link lists are capped at 100 without pagination, with total counts; no links produce an empty sharedSiteFromLinks list.
A missing active document, read failure or timeout raises an error; partial data is not returned.


If more than one Revit instance is running, document is required; otherwise any instance may respond.

## Revit year support {#year-support}

| Revit year | Validation |
| --- | --- |
| 2020 | <span class="state ok">Validated live</span> |
| 2026 | <span class="state ok">Validated live</span> |
| 2022–2025 / 2027 | <span class="state part">Build only, not live-tested</span> |

Validated live means an execution was recorded on a real workstation. Build only means compilation passed, not live functional validation. Revit 2021 is outside this project's build targets.
