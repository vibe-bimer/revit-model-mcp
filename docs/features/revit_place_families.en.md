Load optional families and place instances in one transaction and undo entry

!!! warning "Actions require both write gates"
    Set `REVIT_MCP_ALLOW_WRITE=1` in the client and create the workstation `allow-write` file. The action connection must address one Revit instance; use `document` when it has multiple open documents. Selection, navigation and isolation also require the target document to be active.

## Copyable prompts {#prompts}

```text
Load the Double Door family, then place two instances in the meeting room
```

## Parameters {#parameters}

<div class="rmc-tablewrap" markdown="1">

| Parameter {scope=col} | Required {scope=col} | Default {scope=col} | Type {scope=col} | Meaning {scope=col} |
| --- | :--: | --- | --- | --- |
| `at_rooms` | No | `null` | `any / null` | Placement of one family instance per room, with family, type, level and rooms. |
| `dry_run` | No | `false` | `boolean` | rehearse: execute, return the same verification block, then roll back |
| `load` | No | `null` | `array<string> / null` | family file to load |
| `placements` | No | `null` | `array<any> / null` | family instances to place, each with family, type and coordinates |
| `stop_on_error` | No | `true` | `boolean` | stop placing instances at the first error |

</div>

### Common parameters {#common-parameters}

<div class="rmc-tablewrap" markdown="1">

| Parameter {scope=col} | Required {scope=col} | Default {scope=col} | Type {scope=col} | Meaning {scope=col} |
| --- | :--: | --- | --- | --- |
| `document` | No | `null` | `string / null` | Case-insensitive document-title or file-name substring. Reads use it to address an instance; it must be unique with multiple instances. Actions use it to choose an open document in the addressed instance; required with multiple open documents. Unknown or ambiguous targets are rejected |
| `timeout_seconds` | No | `600` | `integer` | Positive result-wait budget in seconds after pickup (default 120); HTTP uses it as the response budget. Does not override add-in execution limits; a timeout does not cancel a pending job |

</div>

## Behavior and returned data {#contract}

## Revit year support {#year-support}

| Revit year | Validation |
| --- | --- |
| 2020 | <span class="state part">Build only, not live-tested</span> |
| 2026 | <span class="state part">Build only, not live-tested</span> |
| 2022–2025 / 2027 | <span class="state part">Build only, not live-tested</span> |

Validated live means an execution was recorded on a real workstation. Build only means compilation passed, not live functional validation. Revit 2021 is outside this project's build targets.
