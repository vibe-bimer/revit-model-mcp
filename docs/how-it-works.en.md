# How it works

The Python server runs beside the MCP client and communicates over stdio.
The add-in runs inside Revit on Windows and reads the active document through an ExternalEvent.
A remote client can use HTTP with a bearer token or the SSH file channel.

## Compatibility

The add-in targets the lowest stable Revit API build of each supported year for compatibility with every patch of that year.

## First call

1. Revit loads `RevitModelMcp.addin` and starts a file watcher, heartbeat and optional HTTP listener.
2. The MCP client calls `revit_ping`; the server constructs `{"command":"ping"}`.
3. HTTP queues the job in memory; local or SSH mode publishes it as `trigger.txt` in the Windows channel directory.
4. An ExternalEvent invokes the shared command handler on Revit's API thread.
5. The handler returns `success:true` with `data:"pong"`; the server delivers the JSON result over MCP.

The channel directory defaults to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RevitModelMcp`, not `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RevitDevLoader`.
The add-in loads directly through its manifest and does not require a separate loader.
The [feed format](feed-format.md) documents paths and response fields.

## Read-only and actions

The default tools read model data or export a view to PNG.
Exports and diagnostics write files outside the Revit model.
Actions appear in MCP only when the Python process starts with `REVIT_MCP_ALLOW_WRITE=1`.
The add-in also requires `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RevitModelMcp\allow-write` for every action.
Deleting that gate file disables action execution without restarting Revit.
The MCP environment gate controls tool registration; direct HTTP callers are checked against the token and workstation gate.

Selection and navigation use UI calls.
Model changes and temporary isolation run in individual transactions.
`revit_batch` groups the per-step transactions in a `TransactionGroup` with one undo entry on success and one rollback of the group on failure or a batch dry run.
Warnings are dismissed and reported on success; unresolved errors roll back the action.
Action handling attempts TaskDialog overrides and reports their messages.
The tools do not save the model.

## Routing and waiting

HTTP defaults to `127.0.0.1:53110`; the bearer token is stored in the per-user `settings.json`.
Each HTTP endpoint belongs to one Revit process.
A tunnel can connect a remote client while the listener stays on loopback.
See [transport configuration](transport.md) for LAN and Tailscale routes.

Local and SSH modes run Windows PowerShell under the Revit account.
They locate responses by command and filename; they have no request correlation ID.
Use one server process per file channel directory and a distinctive `document` filter for multiple Revit instances.
HTTP polls by job ID and retains completed results for ten minutes.
Timeouts do not cancel accepted jobs, especially actions.

The [architecture](architecture.md) describes scheduling and failure behavior.
The [server reference](../server/README.md) lists environment settings.

## Model naming defaults

Queries and catalog lookups accept names from the active document.
The snapshot and view dump use the following generic defaults:

| Data | Default |
| --- | --- |
| View dump profile parameters | Names starting with `Project_`, matched without case sensitivity; instance values take precedence over type values |
| View dump measurements | `Length`, `Thickness`, `Area`, and `Volume`, matched without case sensitivity; lengths are reported in millimeters, areas in square meters, and volumes in cubic meters |
| Snapshot regions | Family instances whose family name contains `Region`, matched without case sensitivity |
| Region comments | Named parameters `Comment 1` and `Comment 2` |
| Annotation parameters | Built-in `Mark`, plus named parameters `Segment`, `Number`, and `Zone Code` |
| Curtain panel parameters | The annotation parameters plus `NameOverride` |
| View counts | Non-template views with the case-sensitive prefixes `Coordination_` and `Construction_` |
| Section prefix labels | Case-sensitive leading text `Coordination` or `Construction`; all other names receive `other` |

Missing annotation, curtain panel, and profile parameter values are omitted; missing region comments are null.
The snapshot exposes `regions`, `regionCount`, region `comment1` and `comment2`, model counts `totalRegions`, `coordinationViews` and `constructionViews`, and panel statistics `panelsWithSegment` and `panelsWithNumber`.
Model names and localized category labels are returned as stored in Revit.
